        <div class="mmm"> 
         
        
        <p>William Shakespeare (1564–1616) was an English playwright, poet, and actor, widely <br>
             regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and one of the most influential  <br>
             figures in world literature. Born in Stratford-upon-Avon, he wrote 39 plays, 154 sonnets,  
              <br>and several narrative poems, exploring themes like love, power, betrayal, and human nature.</p>

            <img src="romeo3.jpg" alt="" class="img23">
         
        <p class="ppp">  Romeo is a romantic yet impulsive young nobleman of the Montague family, defined by his intense   <br>
            emotions and idealism. Initially lovelorn over Rosaline, he instantly forgets her upon meeting Juliet, <br>
             showcasing his fickle passion. His reckless decisions—secretly marrying Juliet, killing Tybalt in vengeance, <br>
              and rashly poisoning himself upon (mistakenly) believing Juliet dead—catalyze the tragedy. Though poetic and loyal, <br>
               his lack of foresight underscores the play’s theme of youthful passion versus destructive haste

                <img src="juliet.jpg" alt="" class="img23">

                <p class="ppp"> Juliet is a 13-year-old girl whose transformation from obedient daughter to defiant woman drives <br>
                     the play. Intelligent and courageous, she questions family loyalty after falling for Romeo, delivering iconic  <br>
                     soliloquies (e.g., “What’s in a name?”). Her fake suicide to escape marrying Paris—and eventual real suicide <br>
                      upon finding Romeo dead—highlights her desperation in a world that denies her agency. Juliet embodies the <br>
                       clash between individual desire and oppressive societal norms.

                <p class="ppp">A well-meaning but flawed Franciscan friar, he acts as Romeo’s mentor and secretly marries the lovers, <br>
                     hoping to end the feud. His misguided plans (the sleeping potion for Juliet) stem from optimism but spiral into disaster. <br>
                      His late arrival to Juliet’s tomb seals their fates, making him a symbol of good intentions undone by poor judgment.

                <p class="ppp"> Romeo’s charismatic, quick-witted best friend, Mercutio is a foil to Romeo’s romanticism. <br> His bawdy humor and “Queen Mab” <br>
                     speech reveal a cynical view of love. When Tybalt kills him, Mercutio curses both houses  <br>
                     (“A plague o’ both your houses!”), turning  <
                     the play from comedy to tragedy. His death exposes the feud’s pointless brutality.

                he provokes Romeo at the ball and kills Mercutio, triggering Romeo’s revenge. <br> Tybalt represents  generational  vendettas that doom the young. <br>
